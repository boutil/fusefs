OS X Gotcha
============

If you're using fusefs with MacFuse on Snow Leopard (and possibly in other
circumstances), and you get the error:

/usr/local/include/fuse/fuse_compat.h:69:24: error: sys/statfs.h: No such file or directory

Just comment that line out of fuse_compat.h.

FuseFS README
============

    FuseFS is a library aimed at allowing Ruby programmers to quickly and
  easily create virtual filesystems with little more than a few lines of code.
  
    A "hello world" file system equivalent to the one demonstrated on
  fuse.sourceforge.org is just 20 lines of code!

    FuseFS is *NOT* a full implementation of the FUSE api. rfuse
  is designed for that.


Requirements
------------

  * FUSE (http://fuse.sourceforge.org)
  * Ruby 1.8
 (* C compiler)


Install
-------

	gem install fizx-fusefs

Usage
-----

  Some sample ruby filesystems are listed in "sample/"

  When you run a fusefs script, it will listen on a socket indefinitely, so
  either background the script or open another terminal to mosey around in the
  filesystem.

  Also, check the API.txt file for more use.
